## VEOSCRIPT PORTAL
This is my official blog page and portfolio, where you can also share your thoughts and create your own blog post.
This project is using Next JS as front-end and back-end by Prisma and PostgreSQL.

## Website Features
- Create blog post such as articles or other discussion
- Commenting and liking the blogs

I am using GraphCMS before but I switched to Prisma to gain more knowledge about it.
You can clone and fork this project for educational purposes.
